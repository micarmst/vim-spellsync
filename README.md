# ðŸª„ vim-spellsync

Magically rebuild Vim spell files if word lists are modified outside of Vim. One use case would be if word lists are stored in a source control system like Git and shared across multiple computers. SpellSync also creates `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files in Vim's spell directories to exclude binary spell files and uses its union merge driver to avoid conflicts.

## Install

Using a plugin manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'micarmst/vim-spellsync'
```

## Usage

The plugin runs automatically at startup by default. It can also be called with the `:SpellSync` command.

## Config

Below are the options available and their default values:

```vim
" Run SpellSync automatically when Vim starts
let g:spellsync_run_at_startup = 1

" Enable the Git union merge option
" Creates a .gitattributes file in the spell directories if one does not exist
let g:spellsync_enable_git_union_merge = 1

" Enable Git ignore for binary spell files
" Creates a .gitignore file in the spell directories if one does not exist
let g:spellsync_enable_git_ignore = 1
```

## How it works

When a word is added to a custom dictionary, Vim appends it to the word list and then generates a binary version of that word list which it uses instead for performance. If a word list is modified outside of Vim (e.g. via source control) then the binary spell file won't be updated and Vim will continue to mark any new words as spelling mistakes.

The plugin iterates through any spell folders in the Vim runtime and/or any spell files that have been configured. If a word list has been modified then it rebuilds the binary spell file to match.

It also tries to make keeping word lists in source control easier to manage. First it creates a `.gitignore` file if one does not exist in the spell folder, this excludes binary `*.spl` and `*.sug` files from being commited. Second, it creates a `.gitattributes` file if one does not already exist and sets Git to use its union merge driver for the spell folder. This prevents merge conflicts if word lists are being modified from multiple locations.
